; Rename or copy this to InstallerJukebox.ini in the same directory that

; out of the box!
;
; Every section execept [General] and [installer_NSIS] represents a package. For
; each package, the "Output file" option must be configured to a full path and
; filename, including extension (.exe). Everything else is optional. To disable
; a package, delete or comment out its entire section.

; IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS:
; Don't use single backslashes for path names (like D:\temp). Write either
; D:\\temp or D:/temp.


[General]

; REQUIRED: Working directory for temporary files. Since files are not created
; in a safe way for global temporary directories, it is recommended to use a
; dedicated directory for this task only.
Working directory =

; Default installer type. Only NSIS is supported by now.
Installer = NSIS

; When to keep temporary files after building a package: Defaults to "never"
; which is the best choice for most people. The other options are mostly useful
; for development and testing to prevent downloading stuff over and over again.
; "onError" only keeps files if an error occurs during package creation, and
; "always" keeps files unconditionally.
Keep temp files = never

; Program and arguments to extract 7z archives, with placeholders (only required
; for VLC Media Player). If not given, defaults to 7z x -o%TARGETDIR% %ARCHIVE%
7z extraction command = 7z
7z extraction args = x -o%TARGETDIR% %ARCHIVE%

; By default, makensis is invoked as "makensis", which requires makensis in the

makensis =

; Some GNU/Linux distributions ship NSIS packages with a System plugin that does
; not support the "call" function. If makensis fails with a message "Invalid
; command: System::Call":
; 1. Determine your NSIS version (for example, by invoking makensis without
;    arguments)
; 2. Go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%202/ and download the
;    same NSIS version as a ZIP archive (nsis-<Version>.zip)
; 3. Extract the file Plugins/System.dll from the ZIP archive to an arbitrary
;    location.
; 4. Either replace the default System.dll with the version you just downloaded,
;    or specify its location (full path and filename) here:

; en_US.
Language = en_US

; The following settings may only have an effect when a new version of the MSI
; file (10.0, 10.1...) is installed. They may not be evaluated on minor updates
; (10.1 => 10.1.1, 10.1.1 => 10.1.2).

; Suppress reboot prompt. Default: false
Suppress reboot = false

; Suppress EULA dialog on first start. Default: false

; Register Adobe Reader as default PDF viewer. Default: true

[LibreOffice]
Output file =

; Use LO's builtin autoupdater. Default: true. If you use a centralized software
; deployment, this may get in your way or confuse users with update

; themselves.
Use automatic update = true

; Create a shortcut icon on the desktop. Default: false
Desktop shortcut = false

; Activate the quickstarter (systray application) upon user profile creation.
; Default: false. This does not affect existing user profiles, and the
; quickstarter can me manually enabled/disabled afterwards.
Enable Quickstarter by default = false

; Use a template file to configure default settings for all users. The easiest
; way to obtain such a file is to start LibreOffice, adjust settings and copy
; the file %APPDATA%\LibreOffice\3\user\registrymodifications.xcu. Since this
; file may contain many unrelated changes, it's best to start with a blank
; profile (delete the file before starting LibreOffice) and remove unnecessary
; settings from the template.

[Opera]
Output file =

; Create a shortcut icon on the desktop. Default: true
Desktop shortcut = true

; Create a shortcut icon in the quick launch bar. Default: true
Quick launch shortcut = true

; Create a shortcut icon in the start menu. Default: true
Start menu shortcut = true

; Install application and shortcuts in the profile of the user that launches the
; installer, instead of performing a system wide installation. Default: false
Install for current user only = false

; Use a single profile in the program directory for all users instead of a
; separate profile for each user. Default: false
Single profile = false

; Set Opera as the default browser. Default: true
Set default browser = true

; To provide a customized speed dial for new profiles, uncomment the next line
; and set it to a valid speeddial.ini file. The file can have an arbitrary name
; and gets bundled with the installer, so the template does not need to be

; The rest of this section configures some Opera options. There are two forms
; for each option: If an option is suffixed with an asterisk (like "foo*"), it
; will be enforced for all users and cannot be overridden. This may be confusing
; to the user and should only be used for critical options.
; Without the asterisk, it will be used as a default value, but can be
; overridden individually by each user. In that case, it may have no effect on
; existing profiles if the user has already changed the setting.
; If both forms are configured for a single option, the asterisked form takes
; precedence. The non-asterisk option will be written to Opera's config file,
; but it will have no effect.
; If an option is not configured here, the corresponding option is removed from
; Opera's configuration, undoing any previous configuration. Opera will then use
; options from other config files or its builtin default.

; Allow users to store passwords. Default: true. You may want to disable
; password storage for security reasons.
;Use password manager = true

; Use Opera's builtin phishing filter. Default: true. Opera uses an external
; service for this. You may want to disable it for privacy reasons.
;Use phishing filter = true

; Size of the disk cache. Default: 50000. You may want to reduce the size if
; traffic runs through a local caching proxy or there are many profiles on a
; single machine.
;Disk cache size = 50000

; Use Opera's builtin autoupdater. Default: true. If you use a centralized
; software deployment, this may get in your way or confuse users with update
; notifications. Disable it if your users can or should not perform the updates
; themselves. The asterisked form may be useful here.
;Use automatic update* = true

; List of hostnames that can be resolved without a domain part. (i.e. "myserver"
; instead of "myserver.example.com"). Default: empty. If you type "myserver"
; into the address bar and "myserver" is a valid hostname on your network, Opera
; would normally feed that to a search engine, but additionally ask "Did you
; mean http://myserver?". To circumvent the search page and the extra mouse
; click, specify a space-separated list (i.e. "server1 server2 ...") here with
; all hostnames that should be used that way. If that list changes occasionally,
; the asterisk form may be useful for always using the latest set.
; See also "Hostname expansion" and "Search network neighborhood".
;Local hostnames* =

; Try different prefixes (like "www.") and suffixes (like ".com") if a hostname
; does not resolve. Default: true. This may interfere with local hostnames, in
; which case this setting should be disabled.
;Hostname expansion = true

; Try the Windows network neighborhood to resolve local host names. Default:
; true. On some networks this slows down resolution of local hostnames
; significantly. If local hostnames are resolvable via DNS, this setting should
; be disabled.
;Search network neighborhood = true

; Send "Do Not Track" headers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track).
; Default: false.
;Enable Do Not Track Header = false

; Set handler for mailto: URLs. Default: builtin. A value of "builtin" uses
; Opera's internal mail client. "system" uses the system's default mail client.
; Any other value is used as a command line for an external command with the
; usual placeholders.
;Mail handler = builtin

; URL of PAC script (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config).
